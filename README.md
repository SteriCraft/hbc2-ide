# Home Brew Computer 2 - Integrated Development Environment
This repository hosts all of my HBC-2 project files.

It contains documentation about the computer design and an IDE built around a custom assembly language.

## Computer design
The HBC-2 is an 8-bit computer with 64 KB of RAM, a 256 * 192 pixels monitor and a real-time clock.

### Documentation
Full documentation is available in the "Documentation" directory


## Integrated Development Environment
The IDE allows you to create projects, write code with syntax highlighting, check binary output of your code, and run an emulator of the computer easily reaching the 2 MHz target frequency of the CPU.

### Documentation
You can find the IDE project's documentation [here](https://stericraft.github.io/hbc2-ide/)
