When a key is pressed, the keyboard sends two interrupts.

The first code is the key code.

The second code is :
0x0E if the key is pressed,
0x0F if the key is released.

Technically speaking, the IOD chip stores the second interrupt, so that the CPU can
get the data later, after managing the key code.
