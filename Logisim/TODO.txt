-> Update instructions manual, timing diagram incorrect (cycle length and design)
-> If software interrupt, IRT shouldn't retrieve register I from stack
-> INT
-> POP and PSH must impact the carry flag as overflow signal (limit 0xFF)
-> CALL must throw overflow flag if the stack is full and not be executed
   -> stack value limit for CALL = 0xFC
-> interrupts must not be executed if the stack is full
   -> stack value limit for interruptions = 0xFB (because of I register)
-> HLT must set the interrupt flag
-> Interrupt handling must clear halt flag
-> SUB operation throws carry if b > a
-> Address the issue with external and internal data bus
-> Update documentation with new behaviors included above
-> Set "end" µinstr on everything that means nothing to the CPU
-> inc and dec just after full adder opcode in ALU (modify µopcode)
